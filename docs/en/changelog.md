# GensokyoAI Changelog Template

> Positioning: this changelog is publicly released for ordinary users, client developers, and integrators.
>
> Writing principle: explain user-perceivable changes first, then supplement developer compatibility, migration, and protocol information. Ordinary users should be able to understand "what changes after upgrading, whether old data is affected, and whether manual action is needed."

## Version Number Rules

For version format, where to use `v` and where not, and the difference between Runtime protocol version and schema version, see [`versioning.md`](versioning.md).

Brief rules:

- Public versions and changelog use `vYYYY.M.D.N`; the current official release is `v2026.7.14.0`, and the only previous official release was `v2026.5.13.0`.
- Package version in [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml) has no `v`; the current version is `2026.7.14.0`.
- Runtime protocol version uses independent semantic versioning without `v`; it is currently `1.1.0` with major `1`; client compatibility prioritizes `protocol_major_version`.
- Schema versions continue to use integers, e.g. `1`, `2`, `3`.

## Usage

Each time a new version is released, copy the version template below, place it at the top of this file, and delete or write "None" for unused sections.

Each change entry should ideally include:

- What changed.
- Impact on ordinary users.
- Whether manual action is needed.
- Whether old config, old sessions, old memory, character files, or client integration are affected.
- Whether Runtime methods, capabilities, response fields, error structures, or schema versions changed.
- Whether deprecated, removal_pending, removed, or breaking changes are involved; if so, alternatives and migration methods must be given.

## New Features

- New: explain the new capability.
  - User impact: explain what new things users can do.
  - Action needed: explain whether config changes, restart, or dependency reinstallation are needed.

## Behavior Changes

- Change: explain behavior changes of existing features.
  - User impact: explain how the experience differs after upgrade.
  - Compatibility: explain whether old usage still works; if a warning is tightened to an error, specify affected configs.
  - Client impact: explain whether Runtime response fields, error codes, capabilities, or method lists changed.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix: explain the fixed issue.
  - Affected scenarios: explain which users may have encountered it.
  - Upgrade recommendation: explain whether affected users are recommended to upgrade.

## Deprecated but Still Compatible

- Deprecated: explain config, fields, RPC methods, or file formats that are not recommended for continued use.
  - Deprecated object: write the full path or method name, e.g. `runtime.info.old_field` or `legacy_method`.
  - Effective version: write version without `v`, e.g. `2026.5.11.0`.
  - Alternative: explain what to use instead; if no alternative, explain why.
  - Planned removal: explain `remove_after`; write "undetermined" if unknown.
  - Runtime declaration: explain whether it has been written into `runtime.info.deprecated_methods` or `runtime.info.deprecated_fields`.

## Removed or Breaking Changes

- Removal: explain capabilities no longer supported.
  - Scope: explain which users or clients are affected.
  - Breaking level: explain whether `RUNTIME_PROTOCOL_MAJOR_VERSION` or schema version needs to be incremented.
  - Migration: explain how to change config, calling methods, or migrate data.
  - Runtime declaration: explain whether it has been written into `runtime.info.breaking_changes`.

## Data Migration and Upgrade Notes

- Data migration: explain whether this version will migrate sessions, memory, config, or character packages.
  - Automatic migration: explain what the program will handle automatically.
  - Backup location: explain where backup files or export packages are.
  - Failure handling: explain where users should look and how to recover if migration fails.

## Installation and Dependency Changes

- Dependency changes: explain whether Python version, pip / uv installation, Provider SDK, Ollama, or system dependencies changed.
  - Ordinary user action: explain whether dependencies need to be reinstalled.
  - Windows user reminder: explain script, path, or permission issues here if involved.

## Runtime / Client Compatibility

- Runtime protocol version: YYYY.M.D.N
- Runtime protocol major: 1
- Supported clients: explain recommended client versions or minimum compatible versions.
- Method changes: list added, deprecated, or removed methods; write "None" if no changes.
